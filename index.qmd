# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **Introduction to Data Science & Statistics** (AnS 500) for Fall 2025!

## Course Overview

This comprehensive 16-week course is divided into two parts, providing a complete foundation in data science and statistical methods for animal and agricultural sciences. All examples and exercises use R and Quarto for reproducible analysis.

**Duration**: 16 weeks (8 weeks per part)
**Format**: 2 hours lecture per week + homework assignments
**Tools**: R + Quarto exclusively
**Prerequisites**: None (we start from the basics!)

## Part 1: Introduction to Data Science (Weeks 1-8)

The first half introduces you to modern data science practices using R, RStudio, and the tidyverse ecosystem. You'll learn to import, clean, transform, visualize, and communicate data effectively.

### What You'll Learn in Part 1

- **Foundations**: Data science workflow, best practices, project organization
- **R & RStudio**: Getting started, reading data (CSV, Excel)
- **Data Manipulation**: `dplyr` for transforming and summarizing data
- **Visualization**: `ggplot2` for creating publication-quality plots
- **Advanced Topics**: Reshaping data, joining datasets, iteration with `purrr`

### Part 1 Chapters

1. **Foundations of Data Science** - What is data science? Best practices, R/RStudio/Quarto intro, Git/GitHub
2. **R, RStudio & Reading Data** - Interface, projects, packages, importing CSV/Excel
3. **Data Types & Strings** - Types, string manipulation, regex, intro to dplyr
4. **Data Manipulation with dplyr** - mutate, arrange, group_by, summarise, handling NAs
5. **Introduction to ggplot2** - Grammar of Graphics, essential plot types, themes
6. **Advanced ggplot2** - Faceting, statistical layers, combining plots
7. **Reshaping & Joining** - Tidy data, pivoting, joins, functional programming
8. **Special Formats & Wrap-up** - SAS/SPSS/Stata, Excel, janitor, complete workflow

## Part 2: Introduction to Statistics (Weeks 9-16)

The second half builds on your data science skills to conduct statistical analyses. You'll learn frequentist inference, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling.

### What You'll Learn in Part 2

- **Statistical Foundations**: P-values, study design, experimental vs observational
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Measures of central tendency and variability, EDA
- **Probability & Inference**: Normal distribution, Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals
- **Hypothesis Testing**: t-tests, ANOVA, power, Type I/II errors
- **Regression**: Simple and multiple linear regression, model diagnostics

### Part 2 Chapters

1. **Statistical Foundations** - Frequentist vs Bayesian, p-values, RCTs, confounding
2. **Descriptive Statistics** - Mean, median, variance, SD, visualization, outliers
3. **Probability Distributions** - Normal distribution, CLT, sampling distributions
4. **Hypothesis Testing** - t-tests, null/alternative hypotheses, power
5. **ANOVA** - One-way ANOVA, post-hoc tests, multiple comparisons
6. **Categorical Data** - Chi-square, Fisher's exact, odds ratios
7. **Simple Linear Regression** - Correlation, least squares, diagnostics
8. **Multiple Regression** - Multiple predictors, model comparison, variable selection

## R Packages Used

This course makes extensive use of R packages from the tidyverse ecosystem and beyond.

### Part 1 Packages (Data Science)

```r
# Core tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Additional Part 1 packages
install.packages(c(
  "readxl",      # Read Excel files
  "writexl",     # Write Excel files
  "haven",       # Read SAS/SPSS/Stata files
  "janitor",     # Data cleaning
  "lubridate",   # Date/time manipulation
  "cowplot",     # Combining plots
  "patchwork",   # Combining plots (alternative)
  "here",        # Project-relative paths
  "glue"         # String interpolation
))
```

### Part 2 Packages (Statistics)

```r
install.packages(c(
  "broom",       # Tidy statistical output
  "car",         # Companion to Applied Regression
  "effsize",     # Effect size calculations
  "ggpubr",      # Publication-ready plots
  "rstatix",     # Pipe-friendly statistical tests
  "gt",          # Grammar of Tables
  "emmeans"      # Estimated marginal means
))
```

## Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- **Tidyverse-first approach**: Modern R practices from day one
- **Reproducible research**: Every analysis in Quarto
- **Real-world data**: Animal and agricultural science datasets with real messiness
- **Best practices early**: Project organization, naming conventions, version control
- **Statistical thinking**: Understanding over button-pushing
- **Build incrementally**: Each week builds on previous skills

## Getting Started
